# Optimizing KV stores for workloads using Machine Learning

## Overview
The project aims to use frameworks like Ray and MLOS for KV stores, namely Cassandra and Redis, and observe the effect of tuning for workloads generated by YCSB. This is done by first setting up an existing framework named Nautilus to streamline the evaluation of DBMS configurations for Redis and Cassandra. This platform enables measuring the performance of the DBMS configuration under different workloads and hardware configurations. This is followed by tuning the databases using results and a configuration space for each of these databases for multiple iterations. The model is evaluated based on throughput as a result of benchmarks.
